# C# Projects – MovementApp, ShapeAreaApp, AnimalSoundApp

## Overview

This repository contains three focused C# console applications. Each demonstrates a different aspect of object-oriented software construction and provides practical examples of modular design and behavior encapsulation.

### Included Applications

- *ShapeAreaApp* – Calculates areas for geometric shapes.
- *MovementApp* – Simulates movement behaviors for vehicles.
- *AnimalSoundApp* – Simulates sound behaviors for animals.

## Application Summaries

### ShapeAreaApp

Calculates and displays areas for:
- Circle
- Rectangle

Each shape is defined as a class that overrides a common area calculation method.

### MovementApp

Models and executes movement logic for:
- Car
- Bicycle

Each vehicle prints its movement behavior through a shared interface.

### AnimalSoundApp

Represents and triggers animal sounds for:
- Dog
- Cat

Each animal provides its own output for a shared sound method.
